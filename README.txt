ML Assignment - Supervised Regression 
Problem Statement: 
Using Deep Learning techniques, predict the coordinates (x,y) of a pixel which has a value of 
255 for 1 pixel in a given 50x50 pixel grayscale image and all other pixels are 0. You may generate a 
dataset as required for solving the 
problem. Please explain your rationale behind dataset choices. 
Submission: 
● Share your code in a notebook with train logs and graphs showing ground truth and 
predicted coordinates. Show any result you might find useful. 
● Include any necessary dependencies and installation instructions. 
● Ensure the code follows PEP8 and includes comments where necessary. 
● Submit the assignment via a Git repository or a compressed file. 
Evaluation Criteria: 
● Functionality: Does the approach used meet the specified prediction requirements? 
● Approach is more important than accuracy. 
● Code Quality: Is the code well-organized, readable, handles errors and maintainable? 
● Does the model do the job as expected? 
Please submit your responses within 2-3 days once you receive the assignment. 
Feel free to ask for any clarifications you need.
